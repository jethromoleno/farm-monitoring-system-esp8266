🌱 Farm Monitoring System using ESP8266

A smart IoT-based farm monitoring system designed to measure soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors using an ESP8266 microcontroller, with real-time data sent to a cloud dashboard.

📌 Project Overview

This project provides real-time monitoring of important farm conditions using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and multiple sensors. The system is capable of:

- Reading soil moisture levels
- Monitoring temperature & humidity
- Sending sensor data to the cloud via WiFi
- Displaying readings on a web or mobile dashboard
- Triggering alerts in Twitter or X platform

This kind of system helps farmers make data-driven decisions on irrigation and climate control.
